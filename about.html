        <p>I'm a tech enthusiast, a web and software developer with a passion for exploring new programming languages and technologies. With two years of experience under my belt, I've got my hands on a wide range of tech skills, including SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Data Analyst, and Git. I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting tools and techniques to sharpen my programming expertise.

            While my core programming skills lie in SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Data Analyst, and Git, I'm also diving headfirst into learning Java and Angular. I believe that staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices is key to staying ahead in the tech world. My enthusiasm for learning is driven by my eagerness to expand my knowledge and hone my programming skills.
            
            Starting my career as a Junior IT Associate and System Administration intern at CapaCiti, which is now known as UVU Africa, I gained valuable experience in development, troubleshooting, and system administration. My work there helped me understand the importance of being a team player, communication, and problem-solving. I take pride in the skills I've acquired, and I always strive to continue learning and expanding my knowledge base.
            
            I believe that my love for technology is reflected in my work, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.</p>
